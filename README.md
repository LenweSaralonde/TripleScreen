How to use
----------
1. Launch WoW.
2. Make sure your **Display mode** is set to **Fullscreen (windowed)** and **Window size** to **Default** or **Auto** under the graphics options.
3. Run the **.ahk** script that matches your monitor setup.
4. Enjoy!

If there is no **.ahk** script matching your monitor setup, make a copy of one of the scripts, open it in a text editor then change the values for `monitorWidth` and `monitorHeight`.
